# This file is a modified version of the default `vvv-custom.yml` and edited
# for Newspack purposes.

# This file is a YAML formatted file. YAML indenting is done in spaces not
# tabs, and whitespace is significant. If you don't stick to this, it will
# fail on provision

#
# IMPORTANT, if you change this file, you have to reprovision,  no exceptions
# Do this by running either this command:
# vagrant reload --provision
# 
# Or, if your machine is already turned on:
# vagrant provision
#

# These are your websites, and their names map on to the folders they're
# located in. See the docs for how to define these, and what all the keys
# and options are
sites:

  newspack-dev:
    skip_provisioning: false
    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
    hosts:
      - newspack-dev.test

# Utilities are system level items rather than sites, that install tools or packages
# the core utilities install tools such as phpmyadmin
utilities:
  core: # The core VVV utility
    - memcached-admin # Object cache management
    - opcache-status # opcache management
    - phpmyadmin # Web based database client
    - webgrind # PHP Debugging
    - tls-ca # SSL/TLS certificates
    - mongodb # needed for Tideways/XHGui
    - tideways # PHP profiling tool, also installs xhgui
    #- php56
    #- php70
    #- php71

# vm_config controls how Vagrant provisions the virtual machine, and can be used to
# increase the memory given to VVV and the number of CPU cores. 
# It can also be used to override the default provider being used within Vagrant.

vm_config:
  # For WP core development we recommend at least 2GB ( 2048 ),
  # If you have 4GB of RAM, lower this to 768MB or you may encounter issues
  memory: 2048
  # CPU cores:
  cores: 2

  # this tells VVV to use the prebuilt box copied from the USB drive at contributor days
  # once set to false, do not change back to true, and reprovision
  # wordcamp_contributor_day_box: false

  # Due to a limitation within Vagrant, the specified provider is only respected on a clean `vagrant up`
  # as Vagrant currently restricts you to one provider per machine
  # https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/basic_usage.html#vagrant-up
  # provider: vmware_workstation

# General VVV options
general:
  # Backup the databases to the database/backups subfolder on halt/suspend/destroy, set to false to disable
  db_backup: true
  # Import the databases if they're missing from backups
  db_restore: true
